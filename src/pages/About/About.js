            Convert Case is designed to be a free to use online text manipulator
            that you can use for efficiency and productivity gains (and in some
            cases just a bit of fun as well). Whether you have mistakenly
            written all your text in capital or you want to quickly align the
            correct capitalisation structure for titles. Convert Case allows you
            to quickly fix any errors as well as produce an array of outcomes
            from the tools above.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm">
            There are also a range of converters to explore as well such as the
            binary code and morse code translators that will allow you to write
            up standard text and have it translated into the necessary code.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm">
            You can also use the text manipulators to allow your text to stand
            out. Whether thatâ€™s for social media purposes or you want to bring
            some attention to an advertisement, these tools are a great solution
            for fixing those issues too.
