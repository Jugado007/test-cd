        title: "What Is The Average?",
        sentence: "The average is a broad term that is used in various fields of life. Whether you are a student, researcher, or architect, you may have to calculate the average of numerous data sets to solve some problems. But what exactly is 'Average'?",
        tiny: "Well, the term 'average' denotes the central calculated value. When we use average in mathematics, it refers to a number that is a representation of a group of numbers, derived by adding up all the values in the dataset and divided by the total number of values. There are different ways to calculate average like mean, median, and mode. Use our average value calculator to find average of numbers without any hassle.",
        formula: "Here is the Average formula",
        average: "Average = Sum/count"
    },
    {
        title: "Mean & its Types",
        sentence: "The term Mean can be further divided into different parts, and a few of them are discussed below."
    },
    {
        title: "Arithmetic mean",
        sentence: "In this type of mean, you will add all the values of a dataset and then divide it with the total number of values; the resultant will be known as Arithmetic Mean.",
        tiny: "Suppose, the dataset is 7,6,9,4,5,6,8",
        formula: "Arithmetic Mean = 7+6+9+4+5+6+8/7 = 45/7= 6.42",
        average: "A.M = 6.42"
    },
    {
        title: "Geometric Mean",
        sentence: "In Geometric Mean, the values will multiply instead of adding up, and then you have to take the 1/nth after multiplying the values in a data set. For instance, if the values are two, you will have to take square root and if the values are three, you will have to take cube root.",
        tiny: "For instance, for the values 4,6,2,",
        formula: "Geometric Mean= 3√ 4*6*2= 3√48= 3.63",
        average: "G.M = 3.63"
    },
    {
        title: "When to use mean?",
        sentence: "The mean is the most useful and famous measure of central tendency. Mean is mostly used in both discrete and continuous data. However, it is often used in mathematics or accounts related work, in which persistent data is mainly used.",
    },
    {
        title: "How Does the Mean Calculator Calculate the Average?",
        sentence: "To find the mean, Mean Calculator Sum the smallest value and the largest value divide it by 2"
    },
    {
        title: "Median",
        sentence: "The median of a dataset is taken as the middle value, but the dataset should be arranged in ascending or descending order.",
        tiny: "For instance, if you want to find the median for the dataset, 7,9,4,3,6,1,2, then you should first arrange the numbers sequence. It would become: 1,2,3,4,6,7,9",
        formula: "Now, find the total number of values in the list, which is 7. So, 7+1/2= 8/2= 4",
        average: "Median= 4th Value in the sequence= 4."
    },
    {
        title: "When To Use Median",
        sentence: "Median is widely used in the academics but proves as the best option when you have a skewed distribution and want to find the central tendency. What is Skewed Distribution? Well, Skewed Distribution is a set of values in which one of the tails is longer than the other. It becomes crucial in some cases to find the central value of such data, and the median becomes helpful at that time."
    },
    {
        title: "Mode",
        sentence: "The mode of a dataset is considered as a value that repeats most of the time in the given set of numbers.",
        tiny: "For instance, in the data set, 8,4,9,1,4,2,4,1,4,9,3, you can easily find out that number 4 repeats most of the time. So, Mode= 4.",
        formula: "If there is no repetition of a value in a dataset, then the mode will be zero."
    },
    {
        title: "When To Use Mode",
        sentence: "The mode can be used in categorical, discrete, or ordinal data, but it becomes most useful when you are looking for a tendency from a large set of options. For instance, it can be used to find the most favorite food of customers."
    }, {

        title: "Use Average Calculator Instead Of Manual Calculations",
        sentence: "The conventional method of finding averages or mean is a complex and tedious task, which becomes more challenging if the data is ambiguous. In this hectic routine, it may become impossible for a person to waste time and energy on manual calculations. So, the best way to overcome this issue is the use of our Average Calculator.
