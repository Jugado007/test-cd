        title: "What Is Confidence Interval?",
        sentence: "A confidence interval is a range of values that measure the level of certainty or uncertainty after conducting analysis on a sampling method with an anticipated confidence level. Any number of probabilities can be taken by a confidence interval. Basically, the confidence interval computes the range of values that would likely comprise an unknown population parameter.",
        tiny: "For instance, a researcher chooses different samples from the same population and find varying results in each of them. As the results are different, some intervals wouldn’t contain true parameters, while others will. Confidence interval might be a trickier topic to understand due to the complexities involved in it. And solving confidence interval problems is an even more daunting issue. But there’s no need to worry anymore, as you have free access to the confidence interval calculator on SmallSEOTools."

If we look at the confidence interval formula, we can see several factors that can impact the confidence intervals. It’s vital to have narrower confidence intervals as you can gain more information about a population parameter with it. Let’s look into some factors that affect a confidence interval inversely or directly.",

        title: "Size of Sample",
        sentence: "In the confidence interval formula, the size of the sample is represented with n. The sample size works indirectly with a confidence interval; as the size of the sample increases, the confidence interval decreases, and vice. However, all of the other values should remain the same. A bigger sample size generates more reliable results as it has more information about a population parameter.",

The width of the confidence interval increases with the increase in standard deviation. Standard deviation is difficult to estimate but with the population mean calculator, it becomes possible to estimate. The population estimation becomes difficult because large amounts of data aren't existing, but the standard deviation is high.",
